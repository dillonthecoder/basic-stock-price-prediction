DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT SHOULD NOT BE USED TO GUIDE YOUR INVESTMENT OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS. IF YOU USE THIS PROGRAM, OR CREATE SOMETHING BASED ON THIS PROGRAM TO CREATE YOUR OWN PRICE PREDICTION MODEL, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR ANY OF YOUR LOSSES. 

This is my first attempt at making a stock price prediction tool using machine learning. 

Is it accurate with it’s predictions? Not even close actually, but it does work and I learned a lot so I consider this a successful project. Over time I’ll be revising and updating this project so that it continually improves and grows more accurate over time.

The next step is to find a way to include public sentiment of a given stock into the equation, which (in theory) should make it much more accurate.

This project incorporates a lot of fun modules like numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and tensorflow. Using those modules took out so much of the heavy lifting that this project needed I believe anyone could do something like this. 

If you’re interested in machine learning, algorithmic trading, or just want a fun little project to play around with, feel free to reach out on Twitter or LinkedIn and I’ll do my best to explain how it works. Hope to hear from you soon!

Until then, have fun and enjoy coding!
